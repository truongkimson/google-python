Overview

Google for Education - Python is training materials used within Google to introduce Python to people with little programming experience.
More details on this course can be found here https://developers.google.com/edu/python/
I have selected only 2 exercises from this course to practice on since the rest of the exercises are fairly simple and introductory.
The two exercises I have selected are 

Baby Name exercise:

Log Puzzle exercise:

These 2 exercises are aimed at using basic tools from the Regular Expression library 're' to parse useful information from
html files (for 1st exercise) and web server log files (for 2nd exercise). The Log Puzzle exercise also touchs a little on
the use of urllib utilities to handle urls.
